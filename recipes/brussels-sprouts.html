        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Brussels sprouts are one of my all-time favorite vegetables, and this is my favorite way to prepare them. They're crisp but tender and full of flavor.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 slices of bacon (I've successfully used turkey bacon)</li>
            <li>1 lb of Brussels sprouts, or as many as will fit in your pan</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic, sliced (or more!)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of broth or stock, e.g. chicken or vegetable</li>
            <li>1 Tbs butter (2, if using turkey bacon)</li>
            <li>1 Tbs balsamic vinegar (can substitute red wine vinegar or lemon juice for a different flavor, but use less!)</li>
            <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Trim your Brussels sprouts as usual, cutting any large ones in half from the stem. The halved ones are particularly good this way.</li>
            <li>Cook your bacon in a large skillet, then set the bacon aside. Leave the grease in the pan. If you used turkey bacon, add butter or olive oil.</li>
            <li>Brown the Brussels sprouts (cut side down, as applicable) over medium heat, sauteeing once they've reached a nice golden brown.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about one more minute.</li>
            <li>Pour the broth or stock into the pan and cover. Cook for about 5 minutes. Smaller sprouts will be ready sooner.</li>
            <li>Remove the lid and cook away the remaining liquid. If it's evaporating very quickly and they aren't done, you can add a little more.</li>
        </ol>
