        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I love enchiladas, but I'm sometimes too lazy to make them properly. When that happens, I turn to this recipe. It's easy to customize, and it involves less touch time than most enchilada recipes do.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>about 1 cup enchilada sauce (I admit that I usually eyeball the amount)</li>
            <li>corn or flour tortillas, enough to make three complete layers in your dish</li>
            <li>cheese (who measures cheese?)</li>
            <li>1 can of black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>3/4 cup unprepared TVP and seasoning</li>
            <li>spinach or whatever vegetables you like</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Prepare the TVP, rinse and drain the black beans, and sautee or thaw any vegetables that require additional preparation.</li>
            <li>Mix together the beans, TVP, and vegetables. Add a little bit of the enchilada sauce.</li>
            <li>Spray the casserole dish and lay down the first layer of tortillas. (Cutting them in half helps with coverage.) Top with half of the mixture, a layer of cheese, and a layer of tortillas. Thoroughly add enchilada sauce.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining filling and tortillas, topping with the last of the sauce and extra cheese.</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 30 minutes, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes or until the top has begun to brown.</li>
        </ol>
