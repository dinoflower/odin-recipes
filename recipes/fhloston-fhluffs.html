        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These delicate cookies will make you feel like you've won a trip to paradise.</p>
        <p>There's no need to be indimidated by meringues! With a few simple ingredients and a little patience, you'll be super-green.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>two egg whites, ideally at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp cream of tartar</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup + 1 Tbsp granulated sugar, ideally superfine</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract or other flavoring, optional</li>
            <li>blue (or any other color!) gel food coloring, optional</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 200Â°F (be mindful if your oven runs hot) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. (Tip: Parchment paper helps to absorb excess moisture!)</li>
            <li>In a large metal bowl, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar and the salt until soft peaks form. You'll probably want to use an electric mixer.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the sugar and continue to beat until stiff and glossy.</li>
            <li>If using vanilla or another flavoring, fold it in now.</li>
            <li>If using food coloring, paint stripes of it onto the inside of your piping bag or swirl it into the meringue to create random patterns that will pop pop pop!</li>
            <li>Pipe meringues onto your prepared baking sheet. (If you don't have a pastry bag, you can use a spoon.)</li>
            <li>Bake for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Don't open the oven too early! That said, if you like a chewy texture, set a timer for 20 minutes early to check for doneness.</li>
            <li>When the meringues are finished baking, turn off the oven and leave them inside, with the door closed, for three hours. Longer (or overnight!) works perfectly as well.</li>
        </ol>
